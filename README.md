# Thesis Data Analysis (Demo)

This repository contains a demo subset of the data and analysis pipeline from my undergraduate honors thesis:  
**"Exploring the Hyperdirect Pathway’s Impact on Movement Preparation and Execution in Healthy and Parkinsonian Mice"** (Emory University, 2024).

The full dataset is not publicly shared due to research data restrictions, but this demo illustrates the workflow and analytical methods I used to process and interpret behavioral and optogenetic experiments.

## Contents
- `data/` – sample data files
- `notebook/` – Jupyter notebooks for data cleaning, statistical analysis, and visualization  
- `figures/` – example plots generated from the analysis  

## Methods Highlight
- Data cleaning and transformation with **Python (Pandas, NumPy)**  
- Statistical testing (Chi-square, Mann–Whitney U) with **SciPy**  
- Visualization using **Matplotlib, Seaborn**  
- Analysis of reaction times, movement latencies, and error rates across experimental conditions
